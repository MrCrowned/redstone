Notes\r\n\r\n* Longer term ask will be to provide the ability to import the restore into an e-discovery product.\r\n* Longer term ask will be to provide the ability to populate the restore request from a legal hold search: \"find these users who are on legal hold and give me the restore from their machines\".\r\n* Media restore does not meet VMW's RTO for these restores. Direct download of some type (FTP, better restore manager?) may be needed.\r\n* The only data point I have on the size of bulk restores is one company who we are manually doing this for now.

Background\r\n\r\nMozy’s address data has never been adequately validated. Mozy has accumulated millions of unverified addresses in its data stores.\r\n\r\nh1. Problem\r\n\r\nSeveral problems are caused by warehousing addresses of unknown quality. First, the lack of accuracy reduces the utility of the address. For example, location-based reporting could give us additional insights into market performance. Second, the existence of invalid zip codes make it impossible to turn on our external tax assessment engine for the United States (Vertex). Assessing tax accurately in the United States requires street number and route-level validation.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution Concept\r\n\r\nIn order to improve Mozy’s address quality, we must validate newly-entered addresses and clean the current store of addresses.\r\n\r\nWe can validate new addresses by placing controls on address entry in our various systems. We will use the following approach: \r\n\r\n# Identify systems where addresses are edited or saved (e.g. Admin Console, Phoenix, Salesforce)\r\n# Choose address validation/suggestion software (e.g. Google, Melissa Data, Experian)\r\n# Add controls to the UI that validate addresses and suggest valid addresses to the user\r\n# Clean existing data.\r\n\r\nIn any phase, we will only put as much accuracy requirement on existing data as the requirements\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-07-29T19:33:46Z","updated_on":"2013-07-29T19:34:10Z"},{"id":441,"name":"Architecture","identifier":"architecture","description":"The Architecture project consolidates design documents and wiki knowledge for projects that cross DPC components.\r\n\r\n\r\n!https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/attachments/download/36659/dancing_building_in_prague.jpg!","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2014-01-22T20:36:23Z","updated_on":"2014-08-07T17:13:36Z"},{"id":354,"name":"Aria  Sales \u0026 Support Change requests","identifier":"aria_sales_change_requests","description":"This will be a ticket repository to hold all Aria change requests for the following functions\r\nChange a billing date\r\nDeal with an invoice query\r\nDeal with any refund scenario\r\nChange plans that can't be done in BUS\r\n\r\nPlease use this request form for all request:\r\n\"Aria Sales \u0026 Support Change requests\":https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/projects/aria_sales_change_requests/issues/new?issue[description]=1.%20Aria%20ID:%0A%0A2.%20Customer%20Contact%20Email%20Address:%0A%0A3.%20Action%20Required:%0A%0A4.%20Additional%20Information%20to%20Complete%20Request:%0A\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2012-11-15T18:41:45Z","updated_on":"2013-05-06T16:29:40Z"},{"id":371,"name":"Backup Client Improvements","identifier":"bui","description":"This is a list of features/changes to the Mozy clients that will improve the customer experience for our core backup service.","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z","updated_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z"},{"id":376,"name":"Business Operations","identifier":"businessoperations","description":"","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z","updated_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z"},{"id":292,"name":"Data Shuttle Support","identifier":"ds-support","description":"h1.
