This is causing an unnecessary problem and confusion for customers whenever they need to update one of the user passwords. Specifically, for customers who do not have a subdomain setup for a user login, or the sub-admin feature enabled. This is because those customers do not have a method for updating the \"Temporary Password\" to a \"Permanent Password\" so to speak. \r\n\r\nTwo examples of why this causes a problem are:\r\n1. Since customers are not made aware of the change, it's easy to overlook a box that's by default checked. Thinking it's standard procedure to keep it checked at first glance. So when they enter a password and save changes with this checked, when they realize after the fact that they should uncheck the temporary password box, they can no longer use the password that they just entered. Making it a frustrating easy mistake to make and now they have to come up with a new complex password. This very scenario occurred while I was on the phone with a customer. Salesforce Case reference 01444248\r\n2. For HIPAA compliant customers who have to update their password every 90 days, changing the user password is a regular thing for the software to begin backing them up again. The admins for these HIPAA compliant customers are used to updating the passwords for a large amount of users without that box there. In the case these admins overlook that box, a major problem occurs. The problem is that the software installed on all the machines will still reflect they haven't changed the password. Which causes confusion when they know for a fact they went through the process they've done many times before. Salesforce Case reference 01444247\r\n\r\nIn both these examples, those customers did not have subdomains or the sub-admin feature enabled. So even if they wanted to use the temporary password field, they wouldn't be able to. Making it very unnecessary to be there in the first place. \r\n\r\n*Impact:*\r\n\r\nThe impact this has on Mozy is that more customers are calling in frustrated due to circumstances mentioned above. With no added benefit to them, nor notification to keep an eye out for overlooking that box. Which reflects poorly on Mozy for making features they can't use customer facing, for having those features selected by default, and for not making them aware of the problems that can occur due to those changes.  \r\n\r\n*Proposed Solution:*\r\n\r\nI having thought of 4 feasible solutions that could fix this from being an issue, and reducing the volume of customers that call in about this.\r\n\r\n1. The easiest solution, would be to have that box unchecked by default. This way, it's implied as something they would not check under normal circumstances of updating the password as done before. Especially since an admin setting up a password that's only temporary is a special circumstance.\r\n\r\n2. The option for \"Temporary Password\" not being displayed for customers who can't utilize the feature. Specifically, those who do not have the sub-admin or subdomain feature setup. As any change to the user password would have to be done by the admin as permanent, not temporary.\r\n\r\n3. Allowing the \"Temporary Password\" to be updated within the software not just on the web. So after entering the temporary password to authenticate the software, the user/admin setting up the machine could set it up there. Making this feature more user-friendly, and educating the customer what the temporary password box would make occur. \r\n\r\n4. Giving the \"Temporary Password\" field more visibility such as increasing the font, bolding the letters, changing the position, having the prompt saying something like \"Would you like to make this password temporary to be changed after logging in?\" come up after hitting \"save changes\".

The only problem with this is that since you are limiting this query to only one manifest each time, how sure are you that you will not receive the same manifest over and over each time the consolidator makes this query. \r\n\r\nHere is an example of a testcase I wrote that makes the exact same query call to all the manifest partitions:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n6031b4\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\nlogfile=/home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\nunexpected break\r\nin_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb:26\r\nERROR: Test case: T3-2847 not in Test Plan: 617535\r\nFAIL - in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb\r\n[qa9] orared@injector01:~/t3-qa/testcases/consolidator$ in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb ../../config/config.yml \r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766838-107705864.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n6031b4\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n\r\nNotice that the list is consistently the same after during each call? Therefore am not sure how this can determine a next consolidateable manifest unless there is something that happens in the background that I am not able to see in the logs. \r\n\r\nI believe a better approach would have been to grab all the manifests without using \"limit 1\". Hence having a query similar to this:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n\"select id from manifests where vc_enabled = 1 and  patch_count \u003e 1 and id between  '#{start}' and '#{finish}' and id \u003e '' order by id;\"\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n Put the results in some form of data structure from whence you can then call findPatchConsolidation on each manifest and eliminating that from you list, set, array (whichever datastructure) you deem fit to use. \r\n\r\nJust a thought, I may also be wrong in my approach.

Background\r\n\r\nMozy’s address data has never been adequately validated. Mozy has accumulated millions of unverified addresses in its data stores.\r\n\r\nh1. Problem\r\n\r\nSeveral problems are caused by warehousing addresses of unknown quality. First, the lack of accuracy reduces the utility of the address. For example, location-based reporting could give us additional insights into market performance. Second, the existence of invalid zip codes make it impossible to turn on our external tax assessment engine for the United States (Vertex). Assessing tax accurately in the United States requires street number and route-level validation.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution Concept\r\n\r\nIn order to improve Mozy’s address quality, we must validate newly-entered addresses and clean the current store of addresses.\r\n\r\nWe can validate new addresses by placing controls on address entry in our various systems. We will use the following approach: \r\n\r\n# Identify systems where addresses are edited or saved (e.g. Admin Console, Phoenix, Salesforce)\r\n# Choose address validation/suggestion software (e.g. Google, Melissa Data, Experian)\r\n# Add controls to the UI that validate addresses and suggest valid addresses to the user\r\n# Clean existing data.\r\n\r\nIn any phase, we will only put as much accuracy requirement on existing data as the requirements\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-07-29T19:33:46Z","updated_on":"2013-07-29T19:34:10Z"},{"id":441,"name":"Architecture","identifier":"architecture","description":"The Architecture project consolidates design documents and wiki knowledge for projects that cross DPC components.\r\n\r\n\r\n!https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/attachments/download/36659/dancing_building_in_prague.jpg!","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2014-01-22T20:36:23Z","updated_on":"2014-08-07T17:13:36Z"},{"id":354,"name":"Aria  Sales \u0026 Support Change requests","identifier":"aria_sales_change_requests","description":"This will be a ticket repository to hold all Aria change requests for the following functions\r\nChange a billing date\r\nDeal with an invoice query\r\nDeal with any refund scenario\r\nChange plans that can't be done in BUS\r\n\r\nPlease use this request form for all request:\r\n\"Aria Sales \u0026 Support Change requests\":https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/projects/aria_sales_change_requests/issues/new?issue[description]=1.%20Aria%20ID:%0A%0A2.%20Customer%20Contact%20Email%20Address:%0A%0A3.%20Action%20Required:%0A%0A4.%20Additional%20Information%20to%20Complete%20Request:%0A\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2012-11-15T18:41:45Z","updated_on":"2013-05-06T16:29:40Z"},{"id":371,"name":"Backup Client Improvements","identifier":"bui","description":"This is a list of features/changes to the Mozy clients that will improve the customer experience for our core backup service.","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z","updated_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z"},{"id":376,"name":"Business Operations","identifier":"businessoperations","description":"","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z","updated_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z"},{"id":292,"name":"Data Shuttle Support","identifier":"ds-support","description":"h1.
