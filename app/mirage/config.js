I suspect that the deleteManifest command sends off the COMMIT which I presume to be a synchronous operation.  Eventually TMS sees what looks like an idle command and cuts the connection.  We saw similar behavior with SQLite TMS and COMMITs on large manifests during rebase.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two ways to work around this, neither are particularly desirable.\r\n\r\n# Increase general:conntimeout configuration option\r\n This has the side effect of increasing the conntimeout for everything else.  I am not sure what the implications of this are.\r\n# Catch the lib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped exception in gc_manifests.py and continue\r\n It has been observed that the COMMIT does continue on the database server.  Subsequent find_manifests requests for a previously deleted manifest do confirm the manifest is gone.  But There may be other unknown consequences.\r\n \u0026nbsp;\r\n Further if we trap the error we are essentially giving up on a manifest after 4 minutes (the default), if another large manifest is deleted on the same partition while the first is still running we could potentially negatively impact the customer experience for all manifests on that partition.\r\n\r\nExample traceback:\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 140, in \u003cmodule\u003e\r\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 131, in main\r\n    deleteManifest(manifest, host['ip'])\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 58, in deleteManifest\r\n    sc = mdb.DeleteManifest(host, manifest, resp, port=FLAGS.port, force_delete_on_error=FLAGS.delete_on_error)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/mdb.py\", line 205, in DeleteManifest\r\n    response = sendRecvMessage(out_msg, (host, port), **send_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 638, in sendRecvNonWorkingMessage\r\n    timeout=timeout)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 605, in sendRecvMessage\r\n    return sock.sendrecvmsg(message, ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 706, in sendrecvmsg\r\n    return self.recvmsg(ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 698, in recvmsg\r\n    msg = Message(self.stream())\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 48, in __init__\r\n    self.parseFromStream(data_to_parse)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 555, in parseFromStream\r\n    self.__message_header.parseFromStream(data_stream)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 435, in parseFromStream\r\n    header = self._readFromStream(data_stream, header_size)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 142, in _readFromStream\r\n    raise DataStreamStopped, \"Data stream seems to have stopped \" \\\r\nlib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped: Data stream seems to have stopped providing data.\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e","start_date":"2016-02-22","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":8,"name":"Severity","value":"3 - Normal"},{"id":47,"name":"Is Hot Account","value":""},{"id":25,"name":"Documentation","value":"TBD"},{"id":3,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Test Case or Automation Script","value":""},{"id":6,"name":"Build Number","value":""},{"id":11,"name":"Resolved date","value":""},{"id":18,"name":"Environment","value":""},{"id":49,"name":"CFT","value":""}],"created_on":"2016-02-22T20:25:36Z","updated_on":"2016-02-22T20:27:15Z"},{"id":142835,"project":{"id":626,"name":"Consolidator"},"tracker":{"id":2,"name":"Requirement"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":5,"name":"2 - High"},"author":{"id":1328,"name":"Ryan Worthington"},"assigned_to":{"id":10501,"name":"Wendell Porter"},"subject":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time ","description":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time\r\n\r\nThis will allow QE the ability to test Consolidator.

Our customers who have already adopted this enhancement are benefiting from the enhanced protection this technology provides against interruptions caused by Internet congestion, fiber cable cuts, malicious Internet activity, and similar issues outside of our control.\r\n \r\nDUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM, ALL ICS API ACCESS TO OUR DATA CENTERS WILL UTILIZE AKAMAI SUREROUTE TECHNOLOGY AS OF JUNE 30, 2016. THEREFORE, YOU MUST ENSURE YOUR SYSTEMS ARE APPROPRIATELY CONFIGURED FOR ACCESS BY THE MIGRATION DATE.\r\n \r\nNote: the CyberSource Secure Acceptance hosted payment field service has already been migrated to this technology and requires no further action on your part.\r\n \r\n \r\nPREPARING FOR TRANSITION\r\n \r\nThis improved access method requires your systems to route transactions directly to the Akamai cloud, which contains over 100,000 dynamically-addressed proxies—any of which could be used at any time. This large, dynamic IP space is a significant change from our current access configurations. Therefore, it is critically important to test your firewall configurations and ensure you have up-to-date SHA-2 certificates before the June 30, 2016 transition date. WHITE-LISTING IP ADDRESSES WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION, AND OUTBOUND FIREWALL SETTINGS (YOURS, OR THAT OF YOUR COMMERCE PLATFORM PROVIDER) WILL NEED TO BE OPENED TO \"ANY.\"\r\n \r\nAbout PCI Compliance: The core PCI-DSS principle is to employ least privilege and only allow \"authorized\" traffic to be sent, such as the traffic you send to CyberSource.  PCI-DSS 3.0 Sections 1.2 and 1.3 require the restriction of unnecessary traffic traversing the payment data network, which is consistent with routing your traffic to CyberSource domains, an authorized trusted party, via the Akamai cloud (Akamai picks up your traffic at the nearest proxy and routes it to the CyberSource data center).  We strongly recommend that you continue to restrict inbound traffic as well as traffic resulting from an outbound session. Other controls in your environment should address exfiltration of data.  Depending on your environment and configuration, your specific PCI considerations may vary.\r\n \r\n \r\nTESTING \u0026 DEPLOYMENT\r\n \r\nPlease use our test environment (CAS) to test your systems, and then replicate the firewall rules to Production once you are confident your configuration is correct. The new, Akamai-dedicated URLs are similar to those you currently use, but with an \"a\" inserted to designate Akamai routing:\r\n \r\nSimple Order API / SOAP Toolkit API\r\n \r\n   Test Environment: ics2wstesta.ic3.com\r\n   Production Environment: ics2wsa.ic3.com\r\n \r\nSCMP API\r\n \r\n   Test Environment: ics2testa.ic3.com\r\n   Production Environment: ics2a.ic3.com\r\n \r\nAny applications opening secure connections to the CyberSource API endpoints will need to trust the new GeoTrust-signed certificates in use by Akamai.  This is currently the case with the ‘a’ domains listed above, and will be the case for the legacy API endpoints after June 30th, 2016 as well.

Background\r\n\r\nMozy’s address data has never been adequately validated. Mozy has accumulated millions of unverified addresses in its data stores.\r\n\r\nh1. Problem\r\n\r\nSeveral problems are caused by warehousing addresses of unknown quality. First, the lack of accuracy reduces the utility of the address. For example, location-based reporting could give us additional insights into market performance. Second, the existence of invalid zip codes make it impossible to turn on our external tax assessment engine for the United States (Vertex). Assessing tax accurately in the United States requires street number and route-level validation.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution Concept\r\n\r\nIn order to improve Mozy’s address quality, we must validate newly-entered addresses and clean the current store of addresses.\r\n\r\nWe can validate new addresses by placing controls on address entry in our various systems. We will use the following approach: \r\n\r\n# Identify systems where addresses are edited or saved (e.g. Admin Console, Phoenix, Salesforce)\r\n# Choose address validation/suggestion software (e.g. Google, Melissa Data, Experian)\r\n# Add controls to the UI that validate addresses and suggest valid addresses to the user\r\n# Clean existing data.\r\n\r\nIn any phase, we will only put as much accuracy requirement on existing data as the requirements\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-07-29T19:33:46Z","updated_on":"2013-07-29T19:34:10Z"},{"id":441,"name":"Architecture","identifier":"architecture","description":"The Architecture project consolidates design documents and wiki knowledge for projects that cross DPC components.\r\n\r\n\r\n!https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/attachments/download/36659/dancing_building_in_prague.jpg!","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2014-01-22T20:36:23Z","updated_on":"2014-08-07T17:13:36Z"},{"id":354,"name":"Aria  Sales \u0026 Support Change requests","identifier":"aria_sales_change_requests","description":"This will be a ticket repository to hold all Aria change requests for the following functions\r\nChange a billing date\r\nDeal with an invoice query\r\nDeal with any refund scenario\r\nChange plans that can't be done in BUS\r\n\r\nPlease use this request form for all request:\r\n\"Aria Sales \u0026 Support Change requests\":https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/projects/aria_sales_change_requests/issues/new?issue[description]=1.%20Aria%20ID:%0A%0A2.%20Customer%20Contact%20Email%20Address:%0A%0A3.%20Action%20Required:%0A%0A4.%20Additional%20Information%20to%20Complete%20Request:%0A\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2012-11-15T18:41:45Z","updated_on":"2013-05-06T16:29:40Z"},{"id":371,"name":"Backup Client Improvements","identifier":"bui","description":"This is a list of features/changes to the Mozy clients that will improve the customer experience for our core backup service.","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z","updated_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z"},{"id":376,"name":"Business Operations","identifier":"businessoperations","description":"","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z","updated_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z"},{"id":292,"name":"Data Shuttle Support","identifier":"ds-support","description":"h1.
