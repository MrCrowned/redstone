Specifically, the implementation ignores all SSL certificate validation errors, making your app vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could change the affected WebView's content, read transmitted data (such as login credentials), and execute code inside the app using JavaScript.\r\n\r\nPlease address this vulnerability as soon as possible and increment the version number of the upgraded APK. To properly handle SSL certificate validation, change your code to invoke SslErrorHandler.proceed() whenever the certificate presented by the server meets your expectations, and invoke SslErrorHandler.cancel() otherwise. If you are using a 3rd party library that’s responsible for this, please notify the 3rd party and work with them to address the issue.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the SSL error handler, please see our documentation in the Android Developers Help Center. For other technical questions, you can post to Stack Overflow and use the tags “android-security” and “SslErrorHandler.”\r\n\r\nTo confirm you’ve upgraded correctly, submit the updated version to the Developer Console and check back after five hours. If the app hasn’t been upgraded correctly, we will display a warning.\r\n\r\nWhile these specific issues may not affect every app that uses WebView SSL, it’s best to stay up to date on all security patches. Apps with vulnerabilities that expose users to risk of compromise may be considered Dangerous Products in violation of the Content Policy and section 4.4 of the Developer Distribution Agreement.\r\n\r\nApps must also comply with the Developer Distribution Agreement and Content Policy.

Notes\r\n\r\n* Longer term ask will be to provide the ability to import the restore into an e-discovery product.\r\n* Longer term ask will be to provide the ability to populate the restore request from a legal hold search: \"find these users who are on legal hold and give me the restore from their machines\".\r\n* Media restore does not meet VMW's RTO for these restores. Direct download of some type (FTP, better restore manager?) may be needed.\r\n* The only data point I have on the size of bulk restores is one company who we are manually doing this for now.

The only problem with this is that since you are limiting this query to only one manifest each time, how sure are you that you will not receive the same manifest over and over each time the consolidator makes this query. \r\n\r\nHere is an example of a testcase I wrote that makes the exact same query call to all the manifest partitions:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n6031b4\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\nlogfile=/home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\nunexpected break\r\nin_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb:26\r\nERROR: Test case: T3-2847 not in Test Plan: 617535\r\nFAIL - in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb\r\n[qa9] orared@injector01:~/t3-qa/testcases/consolidator$ in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb ../../config/config.yml \r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766838-107705864.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n6031b4\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n\r\nNotice that the list is consistently the same after during each call? Therefore am not sure how this can determine a next consolidateable manifest unless there is something that happens in the background that I am not able to see in the logs. \r\n\r\nI believe a better approach would have been to grab all the manifests without using \"limit 1\". Hence having a query similar to this:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n\"select id from manifests where vc_enabled = 1 and  patch_count \u003e 1 and id between  '#{start}' and '#{finish}' and id \u003e '' order by id;\"\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n Put the results in some form of data structure from whence you can then call findPatchConsolidation on each manifest and eliminating that from you list, set, array (whichever datastructure) you deem fit to use. \r\n\r\nJust a thought, I may also be wrong in my approach.

I suspect that the deleteManifest command sends off the COMMIT which I presume to be a synchronous operation.  Eventually TMS sees what looks like an idle command and cuts the connection.  We saw similar behavior with SQLite TMS and COMMITs on large manifests during rebase.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two ways to work around this, neither are particularly desirable.\r\n\r\n# Increase general:conntimeout configuration option\r\n This has the side effect of increasing the conntimeout for everything else.  I am not sure what the implications of this are.\r\n# Catch the lib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped exception in gc_manifests.py and continue\r\n It has been observed that the COMMIT does continue on the database server.  Subsequent find_manifests requests for a previously deleted manifest do confirm the manifest is gone.  But There may be other unknown consequences.\r\n \u0026nbsp;\r\n Further if we trap the error we are essentially giving up on a manifest after 4 minutes (the default), if another large manifest is deleted on the same partition while the first is still running we could potentially negatively impact the customer experience for all manifests on that partition.\r\n\r\nExample traceback:\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 140, in \u003cmodule\u003e\r\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 131, in main\r\n    deleteManifest(manifest, host['ip'])\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 58, in deleteManifest\r\n    sc = mdb.DeleteManifest(host, manifest, resp, port=FLAGS.port, force_delete_on_error=FLAGS.delete_on_error)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/mdb.py\", line 205, in DeleteManifest\r\n    response = sendRecvMessage(out_msg, (host, port), **send_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 638, in sendRecvNonWorkingMessage\r\n    timeout=timeout)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 605, in sendRecvMessage\r\n    return sock.sendrecvmsg(message, ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 706, in sendrecvmsg\r\n    return self.recvmsg(ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 698, in recvmsg\r\n    msg = Message(self.stream())\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 48, in __init__\r\n    self.parseFromStream(data_to_parse)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 555, in parseFromStream\r\n    self.__message_header.parseFromStream(data_stream)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 435, in parseFromStream\r\n    header = self._readFromStream(data_stream, header_size)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 142, in _readFromStream\r\n    raise DataStreamStopped, \"Data stream seems to have stopped \" \\\r\nlib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped: Data stream seems to have stopped providing data.\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e","start_date":"2016-02-22","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":8,"name":"Severity","value":"3 - Normal"},{"id":47,"name":"Is Hot Account","value":""},{"id":25,"name":"Documentation","value":"TBD"},{"id":3,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Test Case or Automation Script","value":""},{"id":6,"name":"Build Number","value":""},{"id":11,"name":"Resolved date","value":""},{"id":18,"name":"Environment","value":""},{"id":49,"name":"CFT","value":""}],"created_on":"2016-02-22T20:25:36Z","updated_on":"2016-02-22T20:27:15Z"},{"id":142835,"project":{"id":626,"name":"Consolidator"},"tracker":{"id":2,"name":"Requirement"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":5,"name":"2 - High"},"author":{"id":1328,"name":"Ryan Worthington"},"assigned_to":{"id":10501,"name":"Wendell Porter"},"subject":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time ","description":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time\r\n\r\nThis will allow QE the ability to test Consolidator.

Background\r\n\r\nMozy’s address data has never been adequately validated. Mozy has accumulated millions of unverified addresses in its data stores.\r\n\r\nh1. Problem\r\n\r\nSeveral problems are caused by warehousing addresses of unknown quality. First, the lack of accuracy reduces the utility of the address. For example, location-based reporting could give us additional insights into market performance. Second, the existence of invalid zip codes make it impossible to turn on our external tax assessment engine for the United States (Vertex). Assessing tax accurately in the United States requires street number and route-level validation.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution Concept\r\n\r\nIn order to improve Mozy’s address quality, we must validate newly-entered addresses and clean the current store of addresses.\r\n\r\nWe can validate new addresses by placing controls on address entry in our various systems. We will use the following approach: \r\n\r\n# Identify systems where addresses are edited or saved (e.g. Admin Console, Phoenix, Salesforce)\r\n# Choose address validation/suggestion software (e.g. Google, Melissa Data, Experian)\r\n# Add controls to the UI that validate addresses and suggest valid addresses to the user\r\n# Clean existing data.\r\n\r\nIn any phase, we will only put as much accuracy requirement on existing data as the requirements\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-07-29T19:33:46Z","updated_on":"2013-07-29T19:34:10Z"},{"id":441,"name":"Architecture","identifier":"architecture","description":"The Architecture project consolidates design documents and wiki knowledge for projects that cross DPC components.\r\n\r\n\r\n!https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/attachments/download/36659/dancing_building_in_prague.jpg!","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2014-01-22T20:36:23Z","updated_on":"2014-08-07T17:13:36Z"},{"id":354,"name":"Aria  Sales \u0026 Support Change requests","identifier":"aria_sales_change_requests","description":"This will be a ticket repository to hold all Aria change requests for the following functions\r\nChange a billing date\r\nDeal with an invoice query\r\nDeal with any refund scenario\r\nChange plans that can't be done in BUS\r\n\r\nPlease use this request form for all request:\r\n\"Aria Sales \u0026 Support Change requests\":https://redmine.mozy.lab.emc.com/projects/aria_sales_change_requests/issues/new?issue[description]=1.%20Aria%20ID:%0A%0A2.%20Customer%20Contact%20Email%20Address:%0A%0A3.%20Action%20Required:%0A%0A4.%20Additional%20Information%20to%20Complete%20Request:%0A\r\n","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2012-11-15T18:41:45Z","updated_on":"2013-05-06T16:29:40Z"},{"id":371,"name":"Backup Client Improvements","identifier":"bui","description":"This is a list of features/changes to the Mozy clients that will improve the customer experience for our core backup service.","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z","updated_on":"2013-03-05T17:21:21Z"},{"id":376,"name":"Business Operations","identifier":"businessoperations","description":"","parent":{"id":374,"name":"Business Initiatives"},"status":1,"is_public":true,"created_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z","updated_on":"2013-03-07T21:18:22Z"},{"id":292,"name":"Data Shuttle Support","identifier":"ds-support","description":"h1.
