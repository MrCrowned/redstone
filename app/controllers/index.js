The only problem with this is that since you are limiting this query to only one manifest each time, how sure are you that you will not receive the same manifest over and over each time the consolidator makes this query. \r\n\r\nHere is an example of a testcase I wrote that makes the exact same query call to all the manifest partitions:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n6031b4\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\nlogfile=/home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766834-80119951.log\r\nunexpected break\r\nin_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb:26\r\nERROR: Test case: T3-2847 not in Test Plan: 617535\r\nFAIL - in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb\r\n[qa9] orared@injector01:~/t3-qa/testcases/consolidator$ in_dev/2847_consolidator_queries_for_manifests_that_require_consolidation.rb ../../config/config.yml \r\nLog file created: /home/orared/workingdirectory/T3-2847_1456766838-107705864.log\r\n0011b4\r\n205aa4\r\n4021b4\r\n6040b4\r\n801ba4\r\na010b4\r\nc020b4\r\ne011b4\r\n0001babe\r\n2011b4\r\n4011b4\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n6031b4\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n8011b4\r\na021b4\r\nc011b4\r\ne010b4\r\nnil\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n\r\nNotice that the list is consistently the same after during each call? Therefore am not sure how this can determine a next consolidateable manifest unless there is something that happens in the background that I am not able to see in the logs. \r\n\r\nI believe a better approach would have been to grab all the manifests without using \"limit 1\". Hence having a query similar to this:\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n\"select id from manifests where vc_enabled = 1 and  patch_count \u003e 1 and id between  '#{start}' and '#{finish}' and id \u003e '' order by id;\"\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e\r\n Put the results in some form of data structure from whence you can then call findPatchConsolidation on each manifest and eliminating that from you list, set, array (whichever datastructure) you deem fit to use. \r\n\r\nJust a thought, I may also be wrong in my approach.

I suspect that the deleteManifest command sends off the COMMIT which I presume to be a synchronous operation.  Eventually TMS sees what looks like an idle command and cuts the connection.  We saw similar behavior with SQLite TMS and COMMITs on large manifests during rebase.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two ways to work around this, neither are particularly desirable.\r\n\r\n# Increase general:conntimeout configuration option\r\n This has the side effect of increasing the conntimeout for everything else.  I am not sure what the implications of this are.\r\n# Catch the lib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped exception in gc_manifests.py and continue\r\n It has been observed that the COMMIT does continue on the database server.  Subsequent find_manifests requests for a previously deleted manifest do confirm the manifest is gone.  But There may be other unknown consequences.\r\n \u0026nbsp;\r\n Further if we trap the error we are essentially giving up on a manifest after 4 minutes (the default), if another large manifest is deleted on the same partition while the first is still running we could potentially negatively impact the customer experience for all manifests on that partition.\r\n\r\nExample traceback:\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 140, in \u003cmodule\u003e\r\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 131, in main\r\n    deleteManifest(manifest, host['ip'])\r\n  File \"./gc_manifests.py\", line 58, in deleteManifest\r\n    sc = mdb.DeleteManifest(host, manifest, resp, port=FLAGS.port, force_delete_on_error=FLAGS.delete_on_error)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/mdb.py\", line 205, in DeleteManifest\r\n    response = sendRecvMessage(out_msg, (host, port), **send_args)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 638, in sendRecvNonWorkingMessage\r\n    timeout=timeout)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 605, in sendRecvMessage\r\n    return sock.sendrecvmsg(message, ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 706, in sendrecvmsg\r\n    return self.recvmsg(ignore_working=ignore_working)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 698, in recvmsg\r\n    msg = Message(self.stream())\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 48, in __init__\r\n    self.parseFromStream(data_to_parse)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 555, in parseFromStream\r\n    self.__message_header.parseFromStream(data_stream)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 435, in parseFromStream\r\n    header = self._readFromStream(data_stream, header_size)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/mdb-utils/lib/binary_protocol.py\", line 142, in _readFromStream\r\n    raise DataStreamStopped, \"Data stream seems to have stopped \" \\\r\nlib.binary_protocol.DataStreamStopped: Data stream seems to have stopped providing data.\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e","start_date":"2016-02-22","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":8,"name":"Severity","value":"3 - Normal"},{"id":47,"name":"Is Hot Account","value":""},{"id":25,"name":"Documentation","value":"TBD"},{"id":3,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":5,"name":"Test Case or Automation Script","value":""},{"id":6,"name":"Build Number","value":""},{"id":11,"name":"Resolved date","value":""},{"id":18,"name":"Environment","value":""},{"id":49,"name":"CFT","value":""}],"created_on":"2016-02-22T20:25:36Z","updated_on":"2016-02-22T20:27:15Z"},{"id":142835,"project":{"id":626,"name":"Consolidator"},"tracker":{"id":2,"name":"Requirement"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":5,"name":"2 - High"},"author":{"id":1328,"name":"Ryan Worthington"},"assigned_to":{"id":10501,"name":"Wendell Porter"},"subject":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time ","description":"Consolidator: Need startup parameter that will exit consolidator after processing manifest hash range 1 time\r\n\r\nThis will allow QE the ability to test Consolidator.

Our customers who have already adopted this enhancement are benefiting from the enhanced protection this technology provides against interruptions caused by Internet congestion, fiber cable cuts, malicious Internet activity, and similar issues outside of our control.\r\n \r\nDUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM, ALL ICS API ACCESS TO OUR DATA CENTERS WILL UTILIZE AKAMAI SUREROUTE TECHNOLOGY AS OF JUNE 30, 2016. THEREFORE, YOU MUST ENSURE YOUR SYSTEMS ARE APPROPRIATELY CONFIGURED FOR ACCESS BY THE MIGRATION DATE.\r\n \r\nNote: the CyberSource Secure Acceptance hosted payment field service has already been migrated to this technology and requires no further action on your part.\r\n \r\n \r\nPREPARING FOR TRANSITION\r\n \r\nThis improved access method requires your systems to route transactions directly to the Akamai cloud, which contains over 100,000 dynamically-addressed proxies—any of which could be used at any time. This large, dynamic IP space is a significant change from our current access configurations. Therefore, it is critically important to test your firewall configurations and ensure you have up-to-date SHA-2 certificates before the June 30, 2016 transition date. WHITE-LISTING IP ADDRESSES WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION, AND OUTBOUND FIREWALL SETTINGS (YOURS, OR THAT OF YOUR COMMERCE PLATFORM PROVIDER) WILL NEED TO BE OPENED TO \"ANY.\"\r\n \r\nAbout PCI Compliance: The core PCI-DSS principle is to employ least privilege and only allow \"authorized\" traffic to be sent, such as the traffic you send to CyberSource.  PCI-DSS 3.0 Sections 1.2 and 1.3 require the restriction of unnecessary traffic traversing the payment data network, which is consistent with routing your traffic to CyberSource domains, an authorized trusted party, via the Akamai cloud (Akamai picks up your traffic at the nearest proxy and routes it to the CyberSource data center).  We strongly recommend that you continue to restrict inbound traffic as well as traffic resulting from an outbound session. Other controls in your environment should address exfiltration of data.  Depending on your environment and configuration, your specific PCI considerations may vary.\r\n \r\n \r\nTESTING \u0026 DEPLOYMENT\r\n \r\nPlease use our test environment (CAS) to test your systems, and then replicate the firewall rules to Production once you are confident your configuration is correct. The new, Akamai-dedicated URLs are similar to those you currently use, but with an \"a\" inserted to designate Akamai routing:\r\n \r\nSimple Order API / SOAP Toolkit API\r\n \r\n   Test Environment: ics2wstesta.ic3.com\r\n   Production Environment: ics2wsa.ic3.com\r\n \r\nSCMP API\r\n \r\n   Test Environment: ics2testa.ic3.com\r\n   Production Environment: ics2a.ic3.com\r\n \r\nAny applications opening secure connections to the CyberSource API endpoints will need to trust the new GeoTrust-signed certificates in use by Akamai.  This is currently the case with the ‘a’ domains listed above, and will be the case for the legacy API endpoints after June 30th, 2016 as well.  These certificates may be obtained by using a web browser to navigate to either of the URLs listed above and clicking on the ‘padlock’ to view and/or export the certificates as necessary.\r\n \r\nCyberSource advises adding either the intermediate or root-level certificates in use for these URLs to your application trust stores in order to ensure uninterrupted transaction processing once you migrate to the Akamai-enabled infrastructure (either on your chosen migration date to the ‘a’ domains, or June 30th, 2016 - whichever comes first).\r\n \r\nWe urge you to adopt this new configuration as quickly as possible to enjoy the additional reliability and protections provided. Please contact your support representative if you have any questions or require assistance.\r\n \r\n \r\nLEGACY API ENDPOINTS\r\n \r\nThe legacy CyberSource API endpoints will be transitioned over to use the Akamai technology on June 30th, 2016.  All merchants who have not yet moved to the ‘a’ domains by June 30th, must complete testing and environment changes prior to this date in order to ensure uninterrupted transaction processing. \r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nCyberSource Customer Support\r\n ","start_date":"2016-02-14","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":8,"name":"Severity","value":"3 - Normal"},{"id":25,"name":"Documentation","value":"TBD"},{"id":2,"name":"Milestone","value":""},{"id":16,"name":"Resolution ","value":""},{"id":11,"name":"Resolved date","value":""},{"id":18,"name":"Environment","value":""},{"id":26,"name":"Planned Version","value":""},{"id":42,"name":"Scrum Team","value":""},{"id":19,"name":"Sprint","value":"None"},{"id":46,"name":"Sprint Year","value":"2015"},{"id":43,"name":"Scrum Priority","value":""},{"id":44,"name":"StoryPoints","value":""}],"created_on":"2016-02-15T06:37:09Z","updated_on":"2016-02-15T06:38:07Z"}],
